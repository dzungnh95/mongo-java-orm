= MJORM Query Language =
MJORM Query Language (or MQL - pronounced "Michael") allows for SQL (Structured Query Language) like querying of a MongoDB database.  An MQL query can contain many commands separated by a semi colon.

== Command ==
An MQL command has the following structure:

{{{
FROM
   collection_name
   [WHERE 
     condition [, condition ...]]
   action
}}}

  * _collection_name_ is the name of the collection that is being operated on.
  * _condition_ is a query condition that must be met
  * _action_ is the action to perform on the documents in the collection specified that match the specified conditions (or all documents if no conditions are specified)

=== Conditions ===
Conditions are optionally separated by a comma.  There are 3 types of query conditions: field comparison, field function and document function:

=== field comparison ===
MQL supports the following field comparison operators:
  * > - greater than
  * >= - greater than or equal
  * < - less than
  * <= - less than or equal
  * != - not equal
  * <> - not equal
  * =~ - regular expression matching

{{{
FROM
   collection_name
   WHERE
       age > 10
       height >= 12
       weight < 150
       length <= 25
       name != "Jalopy"
       size <> 15
       description =~ /^Distance: [0-9]+/
   action
}}}

=== document functions ===
Document functions define conditions that are used on the document as a whole, the following document functions are available:

==== or ====
{{{
FROM
   collection_name
   WHERE
       or
   action
}}}
